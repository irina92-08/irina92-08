### A little bit about me

<p>In 2023, I became interested in website development. She took courses in web design at the university, where she mastered the basics of CSS and html. After the courses, I made up websites for friends and acquaintances on my own. I wanted to move on, and then I decided that I wanted to be a frontend developer. So I started studying Javascript at the Hexlet School of Programming from 2023-2025</p>
